# Fetch Frontend Takehome
## Intro
Hey, I'm [Matt Vaccaro, a Product Engineer](https://www.mattvaccaro.dev/) from Houston, Texas! Stoked for you to review my work. The app is a fairly simple React app with two screens: auth and home. All data handling is managed through actions and loaders. You can learn more about this in the [React Router Docs](https://reactrouter.com/start/modes).

## Setup

1. Setup the node modules like any old react app
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the app up!
```bash
npm run dev
```
I would include some unit and E2E tests in a project, but I ran out of time ü§∑.


## Using the app
On the auth screen, just enter a name and a valid email. A cookie will then be added to your browser.

The search feature allows you to add any number of breeds and get results. You can favorite any pup by clicking the ‚ù§Ô∏è button, which stores it in local storage. You can manage your favorites by clicking "Edit Favorites" and selecting the X on any pup you're no longer interested in. Lastly, clicking "Show Match" will reveal which pup is destined to be your new friend.

## Final Thoughts
I'm pretty happy with how this little app turned out given the time I had. There are a few things I wish I could have spent more time on:

**Zod schema and types**‚Äì Implementing strong types for all data between the client and server.

**Improved hydration** ‚Äì Right now, every small change forces the actions to run again, which isn‚Äôt very optimal.

**Loading and prefetching** ‚Äì The loading states are a bit rough and could be improved by implementing prefetching (which might eliminate them entirely).

**Mobile design improvements** ‚Äì The mobile UI could use some more refinement.
